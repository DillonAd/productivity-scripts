# Windows

To set up these commands, the `add-tool.bat` tool needs to be run as an Administrator.

## Usage

Go to the directory the desired tool resides and use the command `..\add-tool.bat {tool-name.bat}`. Make sure to include the file extension since Windows can get persnickety about such things with symlinks.
